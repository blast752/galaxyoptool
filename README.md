# GalaxyOPTool

Have you ever felt the need to give that more boost to your Galaxy device? Let's say no to the root, we live a better and quiet life without invalidating the guarantee of our devices, without breaking the safetynet control, and without using the MagiskHide function for each app, also compatible with a lot of devices, like in this case (tested on Galaxy S21 5G). Furthermore, you will not lose stability because they are all official optimizations!

How does it work? It works through the use of ADB commands, from the PC, using the ADB Over WiFi connection (the Watch does not have a charging port) and following all the instructions of the program you will get the desired result!

**BEFORE TO START: ADB IS ALREADY INCLUDED!!** Don't change .bat folder, just open it. For start, you need to do this tasks: Go to the settings, enable developer options, then click on Debug ADB and enable it, connect your device to PC with type-c cable, start **GalaxyOPTool.bat** and when your phone ask for adb permissions, give it and enjoy!

How often should be used? There is no precise timing but I recommend performing it on two occasions: 1 time a month or to each system updates (remember that after each update the changes made will be re -assembled because it overwritten by the system.

How much will I see the differences? Does it make miracles? Obviously not, but you will surely get improvements on battery especially in background consumption and you will also have a better general fluidity, as well as part of the disabled logging (best privacy) and other small changes that will improve the general experience.

# VERSION TYPES:
1. CLASSIC: WORKS ON ALL RECENT GALAXYS SMARTPHONES, if you have a doubt, try and tell me
2. WATCH: WORKS ON GALAXY WATCH WITH WEAR OS (actually need testing on TIZEN devices)
